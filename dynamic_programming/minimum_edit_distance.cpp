 * @brief Implementation of [Minimum Edit
 * Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) using Dynamic
 * Programing
 *
 * @details
 *
 * Given two strings str1 & str2 and we have to calculate the minimum
 * number of operations (Insert, Remove, Replace) required to convert
 * str1 to str2.
 *
 * ### Algorithm
 *
 * We will solve this problem using Naive recursion. But as we are
 * approaching with a DP solution. So, we will take a DP array to
 * store the solution of all sub-problems so that we don't have to
 * perform recursion again and again. Now to solve the problem, We
 * can traverse all characters from either right side of the strings
 * or left side. Suppose we will do it from the right side. So, there
 * are two possibilities for every pair of characters being traversed.
 * 1. If the last characters of two strings are the same, Ignore
 * the characters and get the count for the remaining string.
 * So, we get the solution for lengths m-1 and n-1 in a DP array.
 *
 * 2. Else, (If last characters are not the same), we will consider all
 * three operations (Insert, Remove, Replace) on the last character of
 * the first string and compute the minimum cost for all three operations
 * and take the minimum of three values in the DP array.
 * For Insert: Recur for m and n-1
 * For Remove: Recur for for m-1 and n
 * For Replace: Recur for for m-1 and n-1
