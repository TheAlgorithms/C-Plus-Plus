/**

 * @brief C++ Program to calculate the number of positive divisors
 *
 * This algorithm uses the prime factorization approach.
 * Any positive integer can be written as a product of its prime factors.
 * <br/>Let \f$N = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times\cdots\times p_k^{e_k}\f$
 * where \f$p_1,\, p_2,\, \dots,\, p_k\f$ are distinct prime factors of \f$N\f$ and
 * \f$e_1,\, e_2,\, \dots,\, e_k\f$ are respective positive integer exponents.
 * <br/>Each positive divisor of \f$N\f$ is in the form
 * \f$p_1^{g_1}\times p_2^{g_2}\times\cdots\times p_k^{g_k}\f$
 * where \f$0\le g_i\le e_i\f$ are integers for all \f$1\le i\le k\f$.
 * <br/>Finally, there are \f$(e_1+1) \times (e_2+1)\times\cdots\times (e_k+1)\f$
 * positive divisors of \f$N\f$ since we can choose every \f$g_i\f$
 * independently.
 *
 * Example:
 * <br/>\f$N = 36 = (3^2 \cdot 2^2)\f$
 * <br/>\f$\mbox{number_of_positive_divisors}(36) = (2+1) \cdot (2+1) = 9\f$.
 * <br/>list of positive divisors of 36 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36.
 *
 * Similarly, for N = -36 the number of positive divisors remain same.
