 * @brief Calculates the [Cross Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product) and the magnitude of two mathematical 3D vectors.
 *
 *
 * @details Cross Product of two vectors gives a vector.
 * Direction Ratios of a vector are the numeric parts of the given vector. They are the tree parts of the
 * vector which determine the magnitude (value) of the vector.
 * The method of finding a cross product is the same as finding the determinant of an order 3 matrix consisting
 * of the first row with unit vectors of magnitude 1, the second row with the direction ratios of the
 * first vector and the third row with the direction ratios of the second vector.
 * The magnitude of a vector is it's value expressed as a number.
 * Let the direction ratios of the first vector, P be: a, b, c
 * Let the direction ratios of the second vector, Q be: x, y, z
 * Therefore the calculation for the cross product can be arranged as:
 *
 * ```
 * P x Q:
 *  	1	1	1
 *  	a	b	c
 *  	x	y	z
 * ```
 *
 * The direction ratios (DR) are calculated as follows:
 *  	1st DR, J:  (b * z) - (c * y)
 *  	2nd DR, A: -((a * z) - (c * x))
 *  	3rd DR, N:  (a * y) - (b * x)
 *
 * Therefore, the direction ratios of the cross product are: J, A, N
 * The following C++ Program calculates the direction ratios of the cross products of two vector.
 * The program uses a function, cross() for doing so.
 * The direction ratios for the first and the second vector has to be passed one by one seperated by a space character.
 *
 * Magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of the direction ratios.
 *
 * ### Example:
 * An example of a running instance of the executable program:
 *
 * 	Pass the first Vector: 1 2 3
 *	Pass the second Vector: 4 5 6
 *	The cross product is: -3 6 -3
 *	Magnitude: 7.34847
