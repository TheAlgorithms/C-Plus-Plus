# Operating Systems Game 🎮

## A simple game in C++ to learn about threads 🧵 and semaphores 🚦!

- A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization, consisting of a program counter, a stack, and a set of registers, (and a thread ID.)

- Traditional processes have a single thread of control.

- A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system.

- In this game, we will use those concepts to create a really fun mechanic! 🥳

- This is a simple console line game done in C++ using ncurses. The main goal implementing this project is to learn and apply multi-threads in a single process.


### How to Install

- Required libraries: lpthread, ncurses, makefile;

- Install:
`make all`

- Run:
`make run`

### How to Play

- Mechanism: You are the green diamond, try to avoid the red enemies. Use the keyboard arrows to move. The arrows move you to the direction where the arrow symbol is in the game, not to the direction it's pointing. 

# The game
In a post-quarantine world, a USP-São Carlos student, leaving the classrom after a intense O.S class, needs to await the opening of the big-tray. The great problem is that the little-stage is infested with party sellers, so our great USP student must avoid those sellers to not infect himself.

The game mechanics are heavy based in the Back Off Barbarian minigame featured in Castle Crashers.
