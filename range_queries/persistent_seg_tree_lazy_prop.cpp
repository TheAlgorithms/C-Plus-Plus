 * @brief [Persistent segment tree with range updates (lazy
 * propagation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure)
 *
 * @details
 * A normal segment tree facilitates making point updates and range queries in
 * logarithmic time. Lazy propagation preserves the logarithmic time with range
 * updates. So, a segment tree with lazy propagation enables doing range updates
 * and range queries in logarithmic time, but it doesn't save any information
 * about itself before the last update. A persistent data structure always
 * preserves the previous version of itself when it is modified. That is, a new
 * version of the segment tree is generated after every update. It saves all
 * previous versions of itself (before every update) to facilitate doing range
 * queries in any version. More memory is used ,but the logarithmic time is
 * preserved because the new version points to the same nodes, that the previous
 * version points to, that are not affected by the update. That is, only the
 * nodes that are affected by the update and their ancestors are copied. The
 * rest is copied using lazy propagation in the next queries. Thus preserving
 * the logarithmic time because the number of nodes copied after any update is
 * logarithmic.
