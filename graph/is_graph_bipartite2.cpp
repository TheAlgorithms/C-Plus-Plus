/**
 * @brief Check whether a given graph is bipartite or not
 * @details
 * A bipartite graph is the one whose nodes can be divided into two
 * disjoint sets in such a way that the nodes in a set are not
 * connected to each other at all, i.e. no intra-set connections.
 * The only connections that exist are that of inter-set,
 * i.e. the nodes from one set are connected to a subset of nodes
 * in the other set.
 * In this implementation, using a graph in the form of adjacency
 * list, check whether the given graph is a bipartite or not.
