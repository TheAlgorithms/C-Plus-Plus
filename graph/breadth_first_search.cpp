 *
 * \details
 * Breadth First Search also quoted as BFS is a Graph Traversal Algorithm.
 * Time Complexity O(|V| + |E|) where V are the number of vertices and E
 * are the number of edges in the graph.
 *
 * Applications of Breadth First Search are
 *
 * 1. Finding shortest path between two vertices say u and v, with path
 *    length measured by number of edges (an advantage over depth first
 *    search algorithm)
 * 2. Ford-Fulkerson Method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.
 * 3. Testing bipartiteness of a graph.
 * 4. Cheney's Algorithm, Copying garbage collection.
 *
 * And there are many more...
 *
 * <h4>working</h4>
 * In the implementation below we first created a graph using the adjacency
 * list representation of graph.
 * Breadth First Search Works as follows
 * it requires a vertex as a start vertex, Start vertex is that vertex
 * from where you want to start traversing the graph.
 * We maintain a bool array or a vector to keep track of the vertices
 * which we have visited so that we do not traverse the visited vertices
 * again and again and eventually fall into an infinite loop. Along with this
 * boolen array we use a Queue.
 *
 * 1. First we mark the start vertex as visited.
 * 2. Push this visited vertex in the Queue.
 * 3. while the queue is not empty we repeat the following steps
 *
 *      1. Take out an element from the front of queue
 *      2. Explore the adjacency list of this vertex
 *         if element in the adjacency list is not visited then we
 *         push that element into the queue and mark this as visited
