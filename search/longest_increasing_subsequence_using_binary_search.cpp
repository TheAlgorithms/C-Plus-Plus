 * @brief find the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
 * using [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence)
 * @details
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly
 * increasing subsequence.
 * The longest increasing subsequence is described as a subsequence of an array
 * where: All elements of the subsequence are in increasing order. This subsequence
 * itself is of the longest length possible.

 * For solving this problem we have Three Approaches :-

 * Approach 1 :- Using Brute Force
 * The first approach that came to your mind is the Brute Force approach where we
 * generate all subsequences and then manually filter the subsequences whose
 * elements come in increasing order and then return the longest such subsequence.
 * Time Complexity :- O(2^n)
 * It's time complexity is exponential. Therefore we will try some other
 * approaches.

 * Approach 2 :- Using Dynamic Programming
 * To generate all subsequences we will use recursion and in the recursive logic we
 * will figure out a way to solve this problem. Recursive Logic to solve this
 * problem:-
 * 1. We only consider the element in the subsequence if the element is grater then
 * the last element present in the subsequence
 * 2. When we consider the element we will increase the length of subsequence by 1
 * Time Complexity: O(N*N)
 * Space Complexity: O(N*N) + O(N)

 * This approach is better then the previous Brute Force approach so, we can
 * consider this approach.

 * But when the Constraints for the problem is very larger then this approach fails

 * Approach 3 :- Using Binary Search
 * Other approaches use additional space to create a new subsequence Array.
 * Instead, this solution uses the existing nums Array to build the subsequence
 * array. We can do this because the length of the subsequence array will never be
 * longer than the current index.

 * Time complexity: O(nâˆ—log(n))
 * Space complexity: O(1)

 * This approach consider Most optimal Approach for solving this problem
