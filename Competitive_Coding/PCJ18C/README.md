# Description

Since the judge panel is very strict, Chef's cakes must be beautiful and have sharp and precise internal

angles in arithmetic progression.

Given the number of sides, N
, of the cake Chef is baking today and also the measure of its first angle(smallest angle), A, find the measure of the K<sup>th</sup>angle.

**Input:**

    The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
    The next lines contain three space separated integers N, A and K, the number of sides of polygon, the first angle and the K<sup>th</sup> angle respectively.

**Output:**

For each test case, print two space separated integers X
and Y, such that the Kth angle can be written in the form of X/Y and gcd(X,Y)=1

Constraints

    1≤T≤50
    3≤N≤1000
    1≤A≤1000000000
    1≤K≤N

    It is guaranteed the answer is always valid.

Sample Input:
