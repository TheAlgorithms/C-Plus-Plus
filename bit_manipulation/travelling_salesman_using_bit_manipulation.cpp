 * @brief Implementation to
 * [Travelling Salesman problem using bit-masking]
 * (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/travelling-salesman-problem-set-1/)
 *
 * @details
 * Given the distance/cost(as and adjacency matrix) between each city/node to
 * the other city/node , the problem is to find the shortest possible route that
 * visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point or we can
 * say the minimum cost of whole tour.
 *
 * Explanation:
 *  INPUT -> You are given with a adjacency matrix A = {} which contains the
 * distance between two cities/node.
 *
 *  OUTPUT ->  Minimum cost of whole tour from starting point
 *
 * Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2 * 2^n)
 * Space complexity: O(n)
