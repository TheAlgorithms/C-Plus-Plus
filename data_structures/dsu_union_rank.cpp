 * @brief [DSU (Disjoint
 * sets)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set-data_structure)
 * @details
 * dsu : It is a very powerful data structure which keeps track of different
 * clusters(sets) of elements, these sets are disjoint(doesnot have a common
 * element). Disjoint sets uses cases : for finding connected components in a
 * graph, used in Kruskal's algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning tree.
 * Operations that can be performed:
 * 1) UnionSet(i,j): add(element i and j to the set)
 * 2) findSet(i): returns the representative of the set to which i belogngs to.
 * 3) getParents(i): prints the parent of i and so on and so forth.
 * Below is the class-based approach which uses the heuristic of union-ranks.
 * Using union-rank in findSet(i),we are able to get to the representative of i
 * in slightly delayed O(logN) time but it allows us to keep tracks of the
 * parent of i.
